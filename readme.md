# Sub Rusta ðŸ¦€
Your *blazing fast* (hehe) RosaServer replacement! Written from code obtained via a decompilation effort of the Sub Rosa server, we have reimplemented the Sub Rosa dedicated server!

## The goal
The last Sub Rosa update was a very long time ago, and the community has noticed. The goal of this project is to perform CPR on Sub Rosa. Since the Sub Rosa client was written in a way that gives the server a ton of control, the opportunities for custom gamemodes and features on the server are limitless! We wish to use the networking protocol established by Alex to help you achieve that!
